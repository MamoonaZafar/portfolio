                <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>I specialize in developing & designing responsive front-end Web development. Iâ€™m
            passionate about learning new technologies and understand there is
            more than one way to accomplish a task. I am a quick learner and can pick up new tech stacks as
            needed. I believe that being a great developer is not using one
            specific language, but choosing the best tool for the job.</p>
            <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'> I started web developement in 2022 managing multiple e-commerce, Services, Educational
            websites on CMS platforms such as WordPress, Joomla, and
            Shopify. I have experience working directly with clients and taking
            mock wireframes all the way to deployed applications.</p>
